In the mongodb compass, you will see the blog-scheduler database in it.
This is how I have setup the local mongdob.

[Content.js] Sending users_found message to background after extraction. Users: (30) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]
background.bundle.js:1 Error: Could not establish connection. --------- The above is the error occuring in my browser

=======================Error Above=====================

====================Cursor Recommendation==================

Based on the error and the log you're seeing, here's what's happening:
The Issue
The content script is successfully extracting 30 users and trying to send them to the background script using chrome.runtime.sendMessage(), but it's getting the "Receiving end does not exist" error.
Why This Is Happening
Timing Issue: The content script is trying to send a message to the background script, but the background script's message listener might not be properly initialized or ready to receive messages at that exact moment.
Service Worker Context: In Manifest V3, the background script runs as a service worker, which can be suspended when not actively handling requests. The service worker might be in a suspended state when the content script tries to send the message.
Message Listener Not Ready: The background script's message listener might not be fully set up when the content script tries to send the users_found message.
The Flow That's Failing
✅ Content script extracts 30 users successfully
✅ Content script tries to send users_found message to background script
❌ Background script's service worker is not ready to receive the message
❌ Chrome throws "Receiving end does not exist" error

====================Cursor Recommendation Ends==================

The Root Cause
The background script's service worker lifecycle management is causing the communication failure. Service workers can be suspended and restarted, which means the message listeners need to be re-established.
What Should Happen
The background script should be listening for users_found messages and properly handling them, but the service worker might be in a suspended state when the content script tries to send the message.
This is a common issue with Manifest V3 extensions where the background service worker can be suspended for performance reasons, causing communication failures between content scripts and the background scrip

Hi Ali - mongosh
use blog-scheduler
db.createUser({
user: "linkedinpostun",
pwd: "linkedinpostpwd",
roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "blog-scheduler" } ]
})

I have used the same database name blog-scheduler as you were using..
