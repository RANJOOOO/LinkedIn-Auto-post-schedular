Can you develop 2-3 pages application , that will bring titles based on topic , and expand the topic into a 
blog post and schedule to push it into LinkedIn ..? And it should Send connection requests
 to people who linked 
my articles and send them follow up messages. Tell me how much  it costs end to end and 
please make sure for this as well modify the scheduled events 



appraoch that I am thinking to use get the peoples who have reacted.

well now hear me what i need is a button in the extension that will do like when 
click on it. It will first open the linkedin and the take to the place to the user 
posts and what I am think that only extract the reaction of the post who is less 
then 3 or maximum three days old.
we have to then extract the time has been since the post is posted by the user and 
then we have to access the number by accessing it's DOM also the click on the 
reaciton button and then check and copy the profile of each person who actually 
like reacted on the post and then we have to save it.
We have to build a stroage or anything that first need to check if we already 
send the connection request and the follow up message to the user and then if yes 
the skip that profile and if not then send the connection along with the follow up 
message and.
